People keep making fonts wrong, so here's my advice.

Advice for normal people:

1. The bars on the top and bottom of the capital I should always be present, even in a sans-serif font (hence why I just called them "bars" and not "serifs")
2. lowercase l, the numeral 1, and capital I *must* look different. You may type the phrase "11 Illicit Igloos" to test this.
4. Non-lining numerals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-lining_figures) just look ridiculous, and should not be used.
5. If you are designing a romanization scheme for a language, never use the dotless ı / dotted i distinction such as in Turkish and other similar languages. this will lead you into an incredible amount of technical trouble, where the very capitalization of i now depends on locale (something programmers are bad at thinking about). (For those curious, in the Turkish locale i becomes İ.)

Novel advice:

1. There actually should be a devoted character for the apostrophe, which should not be confused with the single right quote, despite the fact that these are the same character in most traditional typography. They should not be the same character; they should be considered distinct characters instead. otherwise how are you going to know when a quotation stops? This dedicated apostrophe character should be somewhat curvy, but not as much as the single quote. But definitely more than the straight single quote! It also should not be confused with any other of the various marks that kind of look like a quotation mark or apostrophe.
2. Also, umlaut and diaeresis should be distinct. the umlaut should look more like ő, but not exactly.

Blue-sky advice:

there should be an opening comma, a closing comma, and a list comma.

there can be a right-colon as well (possibly the direction of the colon should be reinforced by little triangles instead of dots)

the word i (first person pronoun) should not be capitalized. Was to make it clearer in handwriting, but now it's just less clear because I'm not sure if somebody is writing a one or if it's like the start of a different word or some part of something that's been capitalized for some reason like in a title or Roman numeral or something, more commonly now. just have it be a regular word that isn't capitalized. It's not like it's your name! me isn't capitalized.

i wnd j shouldn't have dots at all, actually. It's weird to have letters with disconnected elements so we shouldn't have them. horse might be out of the barn on that one though. Also in the time since I had this opinion advertised my opinion and I don't think it's bad to have these anymore.

instead of A through F, there should be designated hexadecimal digits. (in the optimal character encoding, byte values 00000000 to 00001111 would represent the digits from 0 to 15). they should probably be displayable on a 7-segment display, but i haven't figured out much else about them. They shouldn't be non-lining, though!
