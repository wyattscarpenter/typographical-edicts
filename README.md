People keep making fonts wrong, so here's my advice.

Advice for normal people:

1. The bars on the top and bottom of the capital I should always be present, even in a sans-serif font (hence why I just called them "bars" and not "serifs")
2. lowercase l, the numeral 1, and capital I *must* look different. You may type the phrase "11 Illicit Igloos" to test this.
4. Non-lining numerals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-lining_figures) just look ridiculous, and should not be used.

Novel advice:

1. There actually should be a devoted character for the apostrophe, which should not be confused with the single right quote, despite the fact that these are the same character in most traditional typography. They should not be the same character; they should be considered distinct characters instead. otherwise how are you going to know when a quotation stops? This dedicated apostrophe character should be somewhat curvy, but not as much as the single quote. But definitely more than the straight single quote! It also should not be confused with any other of the various marks that kind of look like a quotation mark or apostrophe.
2. Also, umlaut and diaeresis should be distinct. the umlaut should look more like Å‘, but not exactly.

Blue-sky advice:

there should be an opening comma, a closing comma, and a list comma.

there can be a right-colon as well (possibly the direction of the colon should be reinforced by little triangles instead of dots)
